# MUN Hub App

## Purpose
An MUN ( Model United Nations ) is a debate competition that follows the structure of real UN (UNITED NATIONS) committees, that allows for discourse and discussion about pressing topics in the current political landscape, MUNs can often by overwhelming, participants are required to:
- Create their own speeches.
- Utilise background guides.
- Access delegate handbooks.

Which are often spread out and difficult to keep in one place. The age-old solution to this was the use of google drives to store documents, and external apps such as Evernote, Notion, or the IOS notes app to store their own personal speeches, however there is no reason for which organisers of these MUNs shouldn't strive to improve the experience of their delegates, and thats where mun-hub comes in;

The MUN Hub app aims to streamline the conference experience for delegates by providing a centralized platform to manage all aspects of the event.
